- I specifically work with the UiPath tool where I get chance to work and get involved in different phases of projects starting from requirement gathering, documentation, & developing automations.
- Besides my work, I am active in the community and participate in events outside work & this really motivates me to learn about new technologies connect with people and grow in the RPA and intelligent automation industry.
